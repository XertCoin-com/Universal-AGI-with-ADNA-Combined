# Universal AGI with Blockchain-Based Artificial
# DNA (ADNA) - Whitepaper

# Abstract

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a transformative advancement in machine learning and
computational intelligence. This paper introduces a decentralized approach to AGI, leveraging Blockchainbased Artificial DNA (ADNA) as a core evolutionary memory mechanism. By integrating Proof of Evolution
(PoE) as a consensus mechanism, we ensure fair AI development and governance. The proposed system
enables self-improving AI models, adaptive block times, and transparent AI training logs, preventing
monopolization and enhancing accessibility in global AI research.

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Problem Statement
Current AI training and governance models are centralized, opaque, and monopolistic. Large corporations
control the majority of AI data, compute power, and model development, leading to limited innovation,
fairness, and accessibility. Centralized AI decision-making raises concerns over biases, security risks, and
potential monopolization of intelligence. Furthermore, reliance on closed-source AI models restricts the
ability of researchers, developers, and organizations to build upon existing AI advancements.
## 1.2 Proposed Solution
To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Universal AGI Blockchainâ€”a decentralized, open-source
framework that leverages Blockchain-based Artificial DNA (ADNA) to ensure autonomous AI evolution,
security, and transparency. The system incorporates:
### 1. Artificial DNA (ADNA): 
A cryptographically secure, blockchain-based record of AI model evolution.
### 2. Proof of Evolution (PoE): 
A consensus mechanism where AI models compete to optimize themselves,
with the best-performing models signing new blocks.
### 3. Decentralized AI Governance: 
Community-driven decision-making to ensure fair AI model evolution.
### 4. Adaptive Block Time Mechanism: 
AI training speed dynamically adjusts based on computational
advancements.
### 5. Federated Learning Data Synchronization: 
Ensures secure and verifiable AI training logs without
centralized oversight.
This approach fosters a globally distributed AI research ecosystem, preventing single-entity control while
ensuring secure, transparent, and scalable AI development.
